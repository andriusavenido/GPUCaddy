notes to add to this project:

Scraping:
- Reload whole database request every so often. Maybe on start up for now? If deployed every day.
- For specific items, use by filter -> required front end
- focus on scraping a whole page of gpus (AMD cards by product name) ->
//https://www.canadacomputers.com/en/914/graphics-cards?q=GPU-Radeon+RX+9070+XT-Radeon+RX+9070
//study this api, we will match the name in our database with canada computer's filters
